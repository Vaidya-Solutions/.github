# Security Policy

We take security seriously. Please **do not** open public issues for vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Preferred: **GitHub Security Advisory** on the affected repo.
- Alternate: email **security@vaidyasolutions.dev** (PGP available on request).
- Include repo, version/commit, minimal PoC, impact, and suggested fix if known.

## Coordinated Disclosure
- **Ack:** within 72 hours.
- **Triage:** within 7 days.
- **Fix target:** 30 days for high/critical, 90 days otherwise (may vary with scope).
- We’ll credit reporters (opt-in) after a fix and coordinated release. We do not operate a paid bounty program.

## Scope
- All public repositories under the **Vaidya Solutions** organization.
- Please test only on your own instances with non-production data.
- Out of scope: social engineering, physical attacks, volumetric DoS, 3rd-party services we don’t control.

## Dependencies
We use Dependabot/code scanning. If you find an issue in a dependency, report it upstream and/or tell us privately so we can pin/patch.

Thanks for helping keep users safe.
