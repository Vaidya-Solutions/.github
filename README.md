# Vaidya Solutions

We build **resilient, offline-capable systems** with **Go · Elixir · TypeScript**.  
Focus areas: reliability, privacy-by-default, observability, and simple building blocks that scale.

## What we ship (open-source starters & libs)
- **mcp-plugin-registry-go** — Driver-style builtin plugin registry for MCP servers (Go).
- **mcp-plugin-template-go** — Production-leaning template for building MCP tools in Go.
- **phoenix-otp-resilience-starter** — Phoenix/Elixir OTP starter with Oban jobs, supervision, and health checks.

## Principles
- **Reliability first**: graceful degradation, retries/backoff, and chaos drills.
- **Offline-ready**: local-first modes with clean sync paths.
- **Clear boundaries**: strong interfaces between UI ↔ MCP ↔ services.
- **Observability**: structured logs + traces from day one.
- **Security hygiene**: secret scanning, SBOMs, least privilege.

## Get involved
- Open an issue or discussion in each repo with ideas or questions.
- Small, high-signal PRs welcome (tests and docs included).

## Security
Please report vulnerabilities via **GitHub Security Advisories** for the affected repo.  
Avoid filing public issues for sensitive reports.
