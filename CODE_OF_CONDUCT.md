# Code of Conduct

We’re building helpful, reliable software. We expect everyone interacting in Vaidya repositories to:

- Be respectful and helpful; assume good intent.
- Keep feedback technical and specific; no personal attacks or harassment.
- Protect privacy: no doxxing, no posting PII, keys, or secrets.
- Use inclusive language; keep heated political or off-topic debates out of project spaces.
- Follow project maintainers’ requests on scope and standards.

**Scope.** This applies to all spaces managed by the org: repos, issues, PRs, discussions, and community chat.

**Enforcement.** Maintainers may edit/remove content, close threads, or restrict accounts to protect the community.

**Reporting.** Email **conduct@vaidyasolutions.dev** or contact a maintainer privately. We’ll acknowledge within 72 hours and keep reports confidential when possible.

*Inspired by the spirit of Contributor Covenant 2.1.*
